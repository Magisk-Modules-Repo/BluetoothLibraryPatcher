# Bluetooth Library Patcher

## Description

This module attends to avoid losing bluetooth pairings after reboot or airplane mode switch on rooted samsung devices.

It patches on the fly the bluetooth library and should support most of samsung devices on android Nougat, Oreo, Pie, 10, 11 and 12.

This patch is NOT applicable with an aosp rom, only samsung stock/based.

## Galaxy Watch devices support

Due to limitations in Magisk, a manual step is required to fix pairing issues with Galaxy Watch devices. After installing the Magisk module, use a command line (like Terminal Emulator or Termux) to run the following commands, then reboot:

*Beware! /!\ Owners of the S21 series cannot use these commands (or you have to be SURE your vendor partition isn't read only or full) and must instead use the zip bellow to flash using TWRP. The commands below could brick your device /!\*

```bash
$ su
$ mount -o remount,rw /vendor
$ i=`grep -lr 'security.wsm' /vendor/etc/vintf` && [ ! -z $i ] && [ $i != *.bak ] && cp --preserve=all $i $i.bak && sed -i '/<.*security.wsm.*/,/<hal format="hidl">/d' $i
$ mount -o remount,ro /vendor
```

Alternatively, instead of installing the Magisk module and running the commands, flash the zip file (BluetoothLibraryPatcher_X.X.X.zip​) meant for TWRP recovery found on [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-9/development/zip-libbluetooth-patcher-fix-losing-t4017735) under 'Links'.
